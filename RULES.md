# Rules to be followed for text input (implemented in precheck)

-   use `comma`, `colon` for break/gap in the speech
-   never use `*` for multiplication (write the word `times` instead)
-   use `-` for the word plus or minus
-   `ax` results in axe, use `"A" x` instead
-   use `^` for "to the power of"
